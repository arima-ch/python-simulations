# Python Simulation Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based simulations built for two purposes:
- Visualizing physics-related systems
- Stress-testing the CPU using heavy calculations and rendering

---

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

| File                         | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `particle_simulation.py`     | A particle simulation using pygame that handles large numbers of particles to strain CPU performance. |
| `nbody_cinematic.py`         | A cinematic n-body gravitational simulation built with pyglet and moderngl for high-performance rendering. |

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Install the required libraries using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

\`\`\`bash
python3 particle_simulation.py     # For the particle CPU stress test
python3 nbody_cinematic.py         # For the modernGL n-body cinematic simulation
\`\`\`

---

## ðŸ§  Goal

These projects serve both as physics/graphics experiments and CPU performance benchmarks. They help practice numpy, pyglet, pygame, moderngl, and multiprocessing in Python.

---

## âœ… Future Plans

- More optimized GPU-based simulations
- Fractal or chaos visualizations
- Real-time performance benchmarking
